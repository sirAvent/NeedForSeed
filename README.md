# NeedForSeed
A web application that will help users choose the perfect tree for their yard and redirect them to places they can purchase them. 

# Technologies/Languages
* HTML
* CSS
* W3schools framework 
* VScode

# Inspiration
To help contribute to efforts in restoring natural landscapes, we wanted to create a service that will help educate and promote several trees for users to purchase. 

# What it does
The web application allows users to gain knowledgeable information about particular trees that best fits their environment. For each tree displayed, there is an in depth description regarding the appearance of the trees, the kind of environment they thrive in, the history behind their names.

# Challenges I ran into
Initially our team had chosen to use the Trefle API to help gather data on the ideal growing conditions for plants to create a search engine to consolidate this information in an easy to use service. But after encountering issues with making API calls and CORS errors, we decided to pivot to creating a website that lists information on several trees and provides links for users to purchase them.

# Accomplishments that I'm proud of
Built a page that has scalable content (i.e background, pictures, and text boxes are able to scale to fit the dimesions of the screen)

# What I learned
* Git commands
* CORS policy and same-origin policy
* Requesting information from APIs
* Better familiarity with CSS and different frameworks

# What's next for NeedForSeed

* Expand the number of trees shown
* Displaying a global map of all deforestation
* Using APIs or databases to provide more information to the client
